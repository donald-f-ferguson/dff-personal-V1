## Overview

I have been continuously teaching Computer Science at Columbia University since 2016. I also sporadically taught
prior to 2016. Since 2016, I have taught a total of 32 course sections with an overall total of approximately
7,000 students. I primarily teach:
- COMS W4111 - Introduction to Databases
- COMS W4111 - Cloud Computing

I have also supervised approximately 20 student projects/independent study.

## [COMS W4111 - Introduction to Databases](https://bulletin.columbia.edu/search/?P=COMS%20W4111)

From the course bulletin,

"Description: The course covers what a database system is, how to design databases effectively
and in a principled manner, how to query databases, and how to develop applications using databases:
- entity-relationship modeling
- logical design of relational databases
- relational algebra
- SQL
- database application development
- database security
- an overview of query optimization and transaction processing. 
- Additional topics generally include:
  - NoSQL, graph, object-relational, and cloud databases
  - data preparation and cleaning of real-world data.

The course offers both programming and non-programming paths for homework and projects,
to accommodate students with different programming skills and backgrounds.‚Äù

## [COMS W4111 - Cloud Computing](https://bulletin.columbia.edu/search/?P=w4153)

From the course bulletin,

"Description: Software engineering skills necessary for developing cloud computing and software-as-a-service
applications, covering topics such as service-oriented architectures, message-driven applications,
and platform integration. Includes theoretical study, practical application, and collaborative project work."

I typically cover the following topics:
- Infrastructure-as-a-Service, Container-as-a-Service, Platform-as-a-Service, Function-as-a-Service,
Software-as-a-Service, Data-as-a-Service, ... ...
- Virtualization and containers
- Service Oriented Architecture and Microservices
- Design patterns and best practices
- Service composition and orchestration, workflow management and process automation
- REST, GraphQL, gRPC
- Cloud databases, cloud SQL and NoSQL
- Approaches to scalability and availability
- Transactions, advanced transaction models, sagas
- Event driven processing, message drive processing, pub/sub, message queueing, asynchronous APIs
- API management and API gateways
- Continuous integration and delivery, DevOps, ... ...
- Cloud security, OAuth, OpenID, Java Web Tokens, ... ...
- Basics of browser based user interfaces and Angular
- Approaches to data processing and engineering, e.g. ETL/ELT, Spark, ... ...

The cloud technology is a very dynamic, and the content evolves from semester to semester.
